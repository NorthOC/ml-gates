# Perceptron - Machine Learning

This is a perceptron built with standard C libs which trains to recognise patterns in data.

## An example

So let say I give you a number of inputs and outputs:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
|0      |      0 |
|2      |      4 |
|3      | 6      |
|   9   | 18     |

You would say that the patern is 2, because the input times 2 is equal to the output. So this patern is what the perceptron figures out.
